<h2> AimPractice </h2>
<h3> A program that helps users practice their click accuracy </h3>

----

to run, cd into the AimPractice folder, copy and paste this bad boy:

`
java -jar --module-path <path-to-javafx-sdk-13>/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml ./out/artifacts/AimPractice_jar/AimPractice.jar 
`

make sure to change `<path-to-javafx-sdk-13>` to your actual path

I have no idea how to remove the module dependancies ðŸ˜¬
